# **Vehicle Price Prediction Project**

# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

## **Introduction**
One of the most important practices in the automotive industry is the ability to predict the price of a vehicle. This is especially important for the automotive industry as it is an extremely competitive market and the ability to predict the price of a vehicle is a key factor in the success of a dealership. The ability to predict the price of a vehicle is also important for the consumer as it allows them to make an informed decision on the purchase of a vehicle. This is a perfect area to apply data science techniques as the data is readily available and the problem is well defined.

## **Problem Statement**
The sale of vehicles is a complex process. There are many factors that influence the price which are not always obvious. This could mean that a vehicle is not sold at the price it is worth, or that a vehicle is sold at a price that is too high. This equates to a loss of revenue for the dealership and a loss of value for the customer. To maximize the revenue of a dealership, it is important to understand the factors that influence the sale of a vehicle.

## **Business Task**
The key task is to find out what features have a significant impact on the sale price of a vehicle and build a predictive model that can be used to predict the sale price based on its features. The insights gathered here can be used by the car dealers to price their vehicles competitively and by the customers to get a fair idea of the price of the vehicle they are interested in.

## **The Data**
